### Hi there 👋

Thanks for your visit!

I'm Erick a former Marketing Manager that decided to make a **career shift to become a software engineer**. I love everything that I have built so far, but during COVID-19 I started to learn another profession aiming the long run, but I was so engaged with this new world that I decided to start over now and make it my new living. I'm extremely curious, self-learner and a challenge driven person, please feel free to reach me out.
